## Hangman game
"Hangman" is a classic word-guessing game usually played between two people. One player thinks of a word and draws a series of dashes on a piece of paper to represent each letter of the word. The other player then guesses letters they think might be in the word. If a guessed letter is correct, it is written in its correct position(s) on the dashes. If the guess is incorrect, part of a hangman figure is drawn. The goal for the guessing player is to figure out the word before the full hangman figure is drawn, which typically happens after a predetermined number of incorrect guesses. The game is often used as a fun way to practice spelling and vocabulary.
